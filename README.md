# ikea-lv-chrome-extension

Extension for Chrome that extends IKEA Finland(or any other country that uses the default IKEA page) shopping list 
page with prices and info from IKEA Latvia.

## Background

IKEA has different prices in different countries, but in the case of Latvia, it also has a separate and different webpage that
  1. does not have all the planner applications, (for example, PLATSA builder is missing but parts are sold)
  2. makes it hard to compare prices.
  
Thus, this extension helps mainly estonians(no IKEA in Estonia), who want to use the furniture planners missing from latvian page and decide if it makes sense(price and availability) to go to shop in Finland or Latvia.

It is made for personal use for one specific time, it probably has tons of bugs, and will probably break as soon as they change design or winds change direction, it helped me and maybe helps you.
