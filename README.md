# ikea-lv-chrome-extension

Extension for Chrome that extends IKEA Finland(or any other country that uses the default IKEA page) shopping list 
page with prices and info from IKEA Latvia.

## background

IKEA has different prices in different countries, but in the case of Latvia, it also has a separate and different webpage that
  1. does not have the furniture building applications(kitchen builder, PLATSA builder etc)
  2. makes it hard to compare prices.
  
  
Thus, this extension helps mainly estonians(no IKEA in Estonia), who want to use the furniture building app to build their furniture(available on finnish page), 
and decide if it makes sense(price and availability) to go to shop in Finland or Latvia.
